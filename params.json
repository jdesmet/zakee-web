  "body": "# zakee-web\r\n\r\nI wanted to custom build a close-to JEE 7 Compliant Application Server, using a \r\nminimalistic approach. My aim was also to use as much as possible the reference \r\nimplemenations and avoid any customizations if at all possible.\r\n\r\nBecause of those goals, You should be able to do a plain vanilla install of Tomcat,\r\nand add in additional JEE support by simply using the right combination of Maven\r\nDependencies. There is even a Tomcat Maven Depencency that can download, install,\r\nand deploy to a Tomcat instance with a single command.\r\n\r\nBTW, I kind of wanted to name this project something, so I thought ... \"well, Tomcat\r\nis not really a cat's name, so maybe I can find something more suitable.\"\r\nAs a kid I had a cat. His name was Zakie, and in thoughts similar of Tomee (J-EE), I \r\ntought I could name this project 'Zakee' (which is pronounced the same as the\r\nDutch Zakie anyhow).\r\n\r\n# Create your own\r\n\r\nto create your own web application, you can use this as a template. Just start dropping\r\nin your htmlx and java files. You might also consider configuring the webapp to run,\r\nincluding:\r\n- Adding additional libraries\r\n- Configuring JSF extensions like IceFaces etc\r\n- modifying the context path, which is set in src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml and in\r\nthe pom.xml.\r\n\r\n# Start Tomcat\r\n\r\nThe pom is preconfigured to work with [Cargo Maven Plugin](https://codehaus-cargo.github.io/cargo/Maven2+plugin.html). \r\nto start and deploy the project on tomcat 8 from the command-line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    mvn clean package cargo:run\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the pre-configured settings, it will use servlet port :9090, and ajp port :9009. Once\r\nstarted, you should be able to access the main webpage form [http://localhost:9090/zakee-web/].\r\n\r\nNote that this project will just as well work with NetBeans, for which the cargo\r\nsettings will be ignored. With NetBeans, you can just 'run' the project with a \r\npreconfigured Application Server (Tomcat 8).\r\n\r\n",
