# zakee-web

I wanted to custom build a close-to JEE 7 Compliant Application Server, using a 
minimalistic approach. My aim was also to use as much as possible the reference 
implemenations and avoid any customizations if at all possible.

Because of those goals, You should be able to do a plain vanilla install of Tomcat,
and add in additional JEE support by simply using the right combination of Maven
Dependencies. There is even a Tomcat Maven Depencency that can download, install,
and deploy to a Tomcat instance with a single command.

BTW, I kind of wanted to name this project something, so I thought ... "well, Tomcat
is not really a cat's name, so maybe I can find something more suitable."
As a kid I had a cat. His name was Zakie, and in thoughts similar of Tomee (J-EE), I 
tought I could name this project 'Zakee' (which is pronounced the same as the
Dutch Zakie anyhow).
