<a id="zakee-web" class="anchor" href="#zakee-web" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>zakee-web</h1>

<p>I wanted to custom build a close-to JEE 7 Compliant Application Server, using a 
minimalistic approach. My aim was also to use as much as possible the reference 
implemenations and avoid any customizations if at all possible.</p>

<p>Because of those goals, You should be able to do a plain vanilla install of Tomcat,
and add in additional JEE support by simply using the right combination of Maven
Dependencies. There is even a Tomcat Maven Depencency that can download, install,
and deploy to a Tomcat instance with a single command.</p>

<p>BTW, I kind of wanted to name this project something, so I thought ... "well, Tomcat
is not really a cat's name, so maybe I can find something more suitable."
As a kid I had a cat. His name was Zakie, and in thoughts similar of Tomee (J-EE), I 
tought I could name this project 'Zakee' (which is pronounced the same as the
Dutch Zakie anyhow).</p>

<h1>
<a id="create-your-own" class="anchor" href="#create-your-own" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Create your own</h1>

<p>to create your own web application, you can use this as a template. Just start dropping
in your htmlx and java files. You might also consider configuring the webapp to run,
including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding additional libraries</li>
<li>Configuring JSF extensions like IceFaces etc</li>
<li>modifying the context path, which is set in src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml and in
the pom.xml.</li>
</ul>

<h1>
<a id="start-tomcat" class="anchor" href="#start-tomcat" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Start Tomcat</h1>

<p>The pom is preconfigured to work with <a href="https://codehaus-cargo.github.io/cargo/Maven2+plugin.html">Cargo Maven Plugin</a>. 
to start and deploy the project on tomcat 8 from the command-line:</p>

<pre><code>    mvn clean package cargo:run
</code></pre>

<p>With the pre-configured settings, it will use servlet port :9090, and ajp port :9009. Once
started, you should be able to access the main webpage form [http://localhost:9090/zakee-web/].</p>

<p>Note that this project will just as well work with NetBeans, for which the cargo
settings will be ignored. With NetBeans, you can just 'run' the project with a 
preconfigured Application Server (Tomcat 8).</p>
